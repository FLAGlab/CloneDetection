## Cross-language Clone Detection for Mobile Apps

This online appendix presents the complete evaluation results for our work on cross-language clone detection for mobile device programming languages: Dart, Kortlin, and Swift.

The experiment evaluation is structured in three parts.

1. Clone detection for the basic language features.
2. Clone detection using algorithms from a known (i.e., sorting algorithms) domain.
3. Clone detection on a corpus of mobile app repositories.
